          <div class="p-3 text-justify">

              <h4 class="text-primary">Introduction to Structure</h4>
              An array can be used only to represent a group of data items that belong to the same data type, such as int or char. However, if we want to represent a collection of data items of different types using a single name, array cannot be used. In such a situation, structure is used, which is a method of packing/encapsulating data of different types. <br /><br />
              Therefore a structure can be defined as a user-defined data type that enables us to store the collection of different data types, grouped together under a single name. Each element of a structure is called a member. <br /><br /><br />

              <h4 class="text-primary">Defining a Structure</h4>
              To define a structure, you must use the struct keyword. <br />
              <img src="img/11%20Structure/Structure%20Definition.png" class="img-thumbnail" width="300"/> <br /><br />

              <img src="img/11%20Structure/Structure%20Example.png" class="img-thumbnail" width="200" /><br />

              Here, struct is the keyword; student is structure name which is a new data type; name, rollno and marks are the members of the structure. <br /><br /><br />

              <h4 class="text-primary">Declaring structure variable</h4>
              Once a structure_name is declared as new data type, then variables of that type can be declared in the main function as <br />
              <img src="img/11%20Structure/Structure%20Variable%20Declaring.png" class="img-thumbnail" width="500" /> <br /><br />
              Another way to declare structure variables, at the time of defining the structure. <br />
              <img src="img/11%20Structure/Structure%20Variable%20Declaring%202.png" class="img-thumbnail" width="150" /> <br /><br /><br />
                
              <h4 class="text-primary">Initialization of structure</h4>
              To initialize the member of structure first declare the structure with member then create the structure variable and assign the value as <br />
              <img src="img/11%20Structure/structure.png" class="img-thumbnail" width="500" /> <br /><br /><br />

              <h4 class="text-primary">Accessing Member of Structure</h4>
              The dot ‘.’ operator which is also called member operator connects a structure_variable with a member of the structure. <br />
              <img src="img/11%20Structure/member%20operator.png" class="img-thumbnail" width="300" /> <br /><br /><br />

              <h4 class="text-primary">Array of Structure</h4>
              An array of structure is nothing but just a representation of structure variable as an array. <br />
              <img src="img/11%20Structure/Array%20of%20structure.png" class="img-thumbnail" width="500" /> <br /><br /><br />

              <h4 class="text-primary">Array and Structure</h4>

              <table border="1">
                  <tr>
                      <th>Array</th>
                      <th>Structure</th>
                  </tr>

                  <tr>
                      <td>An array is a collection of related data elements of same type. (homogeneous)</td>
                      <td>A structure can have elements of different types. (heterogenous)</td>
                  </tr>

                  <tr>
                      <td>An array is a derived data type. </td>
                      <td>A structure is a user-defined data type. </td>
                  </tr>

                  <tr>
                      <td>An array behaves like a built-in data types. We can declare an array variable and use it. </td>
                      <td>First we have to define a structure and then declare the variables of that type. </td>
                  </tr>

                  <tr>
                      <td>Array name is pointer to the first element of it.</td>
                      <td>Structure name is not pointer.</td>
                  </tr>
              </table><br /><br />

              <h4 class="text-primary">Structure and Function</h4>
              Like an ordinary variable, a structure variable can also be passed to a function. 
              While passing structure variable to a function it is essential to declare structure above the main function as global structure. <br /><br />
              
              <h4 class="text-primary">Passing an array of structure to a function</h4>
              Passing an array of structure to a function involves the same syntax and characteristics as passing an array of an ordinary type to a function. 
              So while passing array of structure to a function, in calling function name of the structure variable (which is an array of structure) is only required. 
              In called function, name of the structure variable with empty square bracket is required and size is optional. 
              In passing an array of structure to a function, any changes that are made within the function definition are also visible within the calling function.<br /><br />

              <h4 class="text-primary">Pointer to Structure</h4>
              We know that pointer is a variable and is used to hold the address of some other variable. 
              Similary pointer variable can also be used to hold the address of structure variable too. 
              And the link between structure variable and pointer variable is established using structure pointer operator i.e. '->'. <br /><br />

              <h4 class="text-primary">Passing Structure pointer to a function</h4>
              A structure pointer can be passed to a function. When a pointer to a structure is passed as an argument to a function, the function is called by reference. 
              Therefore, any changes that are made within the function definition are also visible within the calling function. <br /><br />
               
              <h4 class="text-primary">Nested Structure (Structure within another Structure)</h4>
              When one structure is declared as the member of another structure then it is called nested structure. The outer structure is known as nesting structure and the inner structure is nested structure. Let us consider a structure date which has members day, month and year. The structure date can be nested within another structure student (i.e. structure date is member of another structure student). <br />
